# Excel-Challenge
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, you will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

## Instructions

Using the Excel workbook in your .zip file, modify and analyze the sample-project data and try to uncover market trends.
* Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.
* Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the outcome column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, canceled, or is currently live.
  * Create a new column called Percent Funded that uses a formula to find how much money a campaign made relative to its initial funding goal.
* Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column according to a three-color scale. The scale should start at 0 with a dark shade of red, and it should transition to green at 100 and blue at 200.
  * Create a new column called Average Donation that uses a formula to find how much each project backer paid on average.
  * Create two new columns, one called Parent Category and another called Sub-Category, that use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into the two new, separate columns.

  * Create a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes your initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category.
* Create a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the table that you created.

* Create a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes your initial sheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently live per sub-category.
* Create a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent category based on the table that you created.
* The dates in the deadline and launched_at columns use Unix timestamps. Fortunately for us, this formula. that can be used to convert these timestamps to a normal date.
  * Create a new column named Date Created Conversion that will use this formula to convert the data contained in launched_at into Excel's date format.
  * Create a new column named Date Ended Conversion that will use this formula to convert the data contained in deadline into Excel's date format.
  * Create a new sheet with a pivot table that has a column of outcome, rows of Date Created Conversion, values based on the count of outcome, and filters based on parent category and Years.
  * Now, create a pivot-chart line graph that visualizes this new table.
* Create a report in Microsoft Word, and answer the following questions:
  * Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
  * What are some limitations of this dataset?
  * What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
